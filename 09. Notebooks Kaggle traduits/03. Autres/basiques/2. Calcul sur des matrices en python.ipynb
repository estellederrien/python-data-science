Sum-Product of First Row \\* 1st Column => Becomes the 1-st_Row-1-st_Column of the resultant Matrix\n\n2. Sum-Product of 1st Row \\* 2-nd Column => Becomes the 1-st_Row-2-nd_Column of the resultant Matrix\n\n### There are four simple rules that will help us in multiplying matrices, listed here:\n\n#### 1. Firstly, we can only multiply two matrices when the number of columns in matrix A is equal to the number of rows in matrix B.\n\n#### 2. Secondly, the first row of matrix A multiplied by the first column of matrix B gives us the first element in the matrix AB, and so on.\n\n#### 3. Thirdly, when multiplying, order matters—specifically, AB ≠ BA.\n\n#### 4. Lastly, the element at row i, column j is the product of the ith row of matrix A and the jth column of matrix B.\n\nFurther read through [this](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/matrix-multiplying.html) for a very nice visual flow of Matrix Multiplication.\n\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/9IETtIo.png)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def matrix_mul(A, B):\n    num_rows_A = len(A)\n    num_columns_A = len(A[0])\n    num_rows_B = len(B)\n    num_columns_B = len(B[0])\n\n    # To multiply an m×n matrix by an n×p matrix, the ns must be the same,\n    # and the result is an m×p matrix.\n    if num_columns_A != num_rows_B:\n        print(\n            \"Matrix multiplication of two arguments not possible as number of columns in first Matrix is NOT equal to the number of rows in second Matrix\")\n        return\n\n    # Create an result matrix which will have\n    # dimensions of num_rows_A x num_columns_B\n    # And fill this matrix with zeros\n    result_matrix = [[0 for i in range(num_columns_B)] for j in range(num_rows_A)]\n\n    # Now implementing the key principle\n    # The element at row i, column j is the product of the ith row of matrix A and the jth column of matrix B.\n\n    for i in range(num_rows_A):\n        for j in range(num_columns_B):\n            for k in range(num_columns_A):\n                # k-th column of A should be the k-th row of B\n                result_matrix[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j]\n    return result_matrix\n\n\nA = [[1, 3, 4],\n     [2, 5, 7],\n     [5, 9, 6]]\n\nB = [[1, 0, 0],\n     [0, 1, 0],\n     [0, 0, 1]]\n\nA1 = [[1, 2],\n      [3, 4]]\n\nB1 = [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n      [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]]\n\n\nA2 = [[1, 3, 4], [5, 9, 6]]\n\nB2 = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]\n\nprint(matrix_mul(A, B))\nprint(matrix_mul(A1, B1))\nprint(matrix_mul(A2, B2))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%% md\n"}},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Q: proportional Probability Sampling\n\nSelect a number randomly with probability proportional to its magnitude from the given array of n elements\n\nconsider an experiment, selecting an element from the list A randomly with probability proportional to its magnitude. assume we are doing the same experiment for 100 times with replacement, in each experiment you will print a number that is selected randomly from A.\n\nEx 1:\nA = [1, 5, 27, 6, 13, 28, 100, 45, 10, 79]\nlet f(x) denote the number of times x getting selected in 100 experiments.\nf(100) > f(79) > f(45) > f(28) > f(27) > f(13) > f(10) > f(6) > f(5) > f(0)\n\n\n### Solution and Explanations and Notes on methods, steps, algorithms\n\nThe below solution is inspired by the explanations given in [this Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16489449/select-element-from-array-with-probability-proportional-to-its-value) question.com\n\n**To explain further on the question** -\n\nI have an array of doubles and I want to select a value from it with the probability of each value being selected being proportional to its value. For example:\n\n```\narr[0] = 100\narr[1] = 200\n```\n\nIn this example, element 0 would have a 66% of being selected and element 1 a 33% chance.\n\n### The general algorithm is\n\n - sum the array\n - Pick a random number between 0 and the sum\n - Accumulate the values starting from the beginning of the array until you are >= to the random value.\n\n**Note: All values must be positive for this to work.**\n\nThe usual technique is to transform the array into an array of cumulative sums:\n\n     [10 60 5 25]  --> [10 70 75 100]\n\nPick a random number in the range from zero up to the cumulative total (in the example: ``0 <= x < 100``).  Then, use [bisection][1] on the cumulative array to locate the index into the original array:\n\n\n    Random variable x      Index in the Cumulative Array      Value in Original Array\n    -----------------      -----------------------------      ----------------------\n     0 <= x < 10                      0                            10\n    10 <= x < 70                      1                            60\n    70 <= x < 75                      2                             5\n    75 <= x < 100                     3                            25\n\nFor example, if the random variable *x* is 4, bisecting the cumulative array gives a position index of 0 which corresponds to 10 in the original array.\n\nAnd, if the random variable *x* is 72, bisecting the cumulative array gives a position index of 2 which corresponds to 5 in the original array.\n\nFor an inverse proportion, the technique is exactly the same except you perform an initial transformation of the array into its reciprocals and then build the cumulative sum array:\n\n    [10 60 5 25]  -->  [1/10  1/60  1/5  1/25]  -->  [1/10  7/60  19/60  107/300]\n\n  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm\n\n### Note on the bisect function and module that I am using in this solution\n\nFrom [official-doc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html) - `bisect.bisect(a, x, lo=0, hi=len(a))` - Returns an insertion point for x in a which comes after (to the right of) any existing entries of x in a.\n\nSome nice explanations from [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bisect-algorithm-functions-in-python/) -\n\nThe purpose of Bisect algorithm is to find a position (i.e. the index) in list where an element needs to be inserted to keep the list sorted.\n\nPython in its definition provides the bisect algorithms using the module “bisect” which allows to keep the list in sorted order after insertion of each element. This is essential as this reduces overhead time required to sort the list again and again after insertion of each element.\n\nImportant Bisection Functions\n\n1. **bisect(list, num, beg, end)** :- This function returns the position in the sorted list, where the number passed in argument can be placed so as to maintain the resultant list in sorted order. If the element is already present in the list, the right most position where element has to be inserted is returned. This function takes 4 arguments, list which has to be worked with, number to insert, starting position in list to consider, ending position which has to be considered.\n\n**bisect’s operation is faster than calling a list’s sort method after each insertion.**\n\nSo in other words the syntax **bisect(list, num, beg, end)** means -\n\n##### Then index of `num` in `list` i is such that each item in `list[:i]` is less than or equal to `num`, and each item in `list[i:]` is greater than `num`. `list` must be a sorted sequence. For any sorted sequence seq, `list[bisect(list,y)-1]==y` is equivalent to `y` in `list`, but is faster if `len(list)` is large. You may pass optional arguments lo and hi to operate on the slice `list[lo:hi]`.\n\n```python\nfrom bisect import bisect\nfrom bisect import bisect_left\n\nli = [1, 3, 4, 4, 4, 6, 7]\n\nprint(\"The rightmost index to insert, so list remains sorted is  : \", end=\"\")\nprint(bisect(li, 4))\n# The rightmost index to insert, so list remains sorted is  : 5\n\nprint(\"The leftmost index to insert, so list remains sorted is  : \", end=\"\")\nprint(bisect_left(li, 4))\n# The leftmost index to insert, so list remains sorted is  : 2\n```"},{"metadata":{"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import random\nfrom bisect import bisect\n\n\ndef pick_a_number_from_list(num_list, n=100):\n    # first calculate the cumulative sum of the list\n    # i.e.  transform the array into an array of cumulative sums:\n    # e.g. [10 60 5 25]  --> [10 70 75 100]\n    cumulative_sum_list = []\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(0, len(num_list)):\n        j += num_list[i]\n        cumulative_sum_list.append(j)\n\n    # If A = [1, 5, 27, 6, 13, 28, 100, 45, 10, 79]\n    # cumulative_sum_list = [1, 6, 33, 39, 52, 80, 180, 225, 235, 314]\n\n    result_list = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        random_num = random.random()\n        # This will output a number between 0 and 1\n        # specifically [0.0, 1.0)\n\n        # Now pick a random number in the range from zero up to the cumulative total\n        # (in the example: 0 <= x < 314).\n        # Then, use bisection on the cumulative array to locate\n        # the index into the original array:\n\n        item_index = bisect(cumulative_sum_list, random_num * cumulative_sum_list[-1])\n\n        result_list.append(num_list[item_index])\n\n    return result_list\n\n\ndef sampling_based_on_magnitude(num_list):\n    for i in range(1, 100):\n        number = pick_a_number_from_list(num_list)\n        print(number)\n\n\nA = [1, 5, 27, 6, 13, 28, 100, 45, 10, 79]\n\n# sampling_based_on_magnitude(A)\n\n''' Would print like below\n\n[100, 5, 79, 100, 100, 100, 100, 27, 45, 28, 79, 79, 100, 100, 28, 27, 100, 79, 6, 28, 27, 13, 13, 45, 45, 100, 13, 6, 27, 100, 6, 79, 100, 27, 10, 100, 79, 45, 28, 13, 5, 28, 45, 45, 28, 45, 79, 79, 6, 79, 5, 45, 79, 6, 45, 79, 100, 45, 100, 27, 79, 13, 45, 28, 79, 100, 100, 79, 28, 100, 100, 100, 100, 45, 13, 79, 79, 79, 28, 27, 27, 100, 79, 45, 100, 79, 45, 100, 45, 28, 100, 100, 45, 79, 100, 100, 45, 45, 79, 100]\n[79, 100, 45, 100, 79, 45, 79, 100, 27, 100, 100, 10, 100, 79, 79, 79, 100, 10, 45, 79, 45, 100, 100, 27, 100, 100, 13, 45, 100, 45, 79, 13, 45, 79, 27, 100, 45, 100, 45, 100, 45, 45, 100, 100, 100, 79, 45, 100, 100, 79, 100, 100, 100, 100, 79, 28, 79, 79, 100, 45, 100, 79, 100, 79, 79, 45, 45, 100, 28, 100, 45, 79, 13, 100, 79, 100, 100, 79, 100, 6, 27, 79, 100, 79, 100, 45, 79, 79, 28, 79, 28, 100, 28, 45, 10, 27, 79, 79, 13, 100]\n...\n'''","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%% md\n"}},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Q: Replace the digits in the string with Hash symbol (#) and remove non-digits\n\nReplace the digits in the string with #\nconsider a string that will have digits in that, we need to remove all the not digits and replace the digits with #\n\nEx 1: A = 234                Output: ###\nEx 2: A = a2b3c4             Output: ###\nEx 3: A = abc                Output:   (empty string)\nEx 5: A = #2a$#b%c%561#      Output: ####"},{"metadata":{"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import re\n\n\ndef replace_digits_and_remove_all_non_digits(str):\n    replacements = [\n        ('\\D', '',),\n        ('\\d', '#'),\n    ]\n\n    for old, new in replacements:\n        str = re.sub(old, new, str)\n\n    return str\n\n\n# Use-cases\ns1 = \"a2b3c4\"\ns2 = \"234\"\ns3 = 'abc'\ns4 = '#2a$#b%c%561#'\nprint(replace_digits_and_remove_all_non_digits(s1))\nprint(replace_digits_and_remove_all_non_digits(s2))\nprint(replace_digits_and_remove_all_non_digits(s3))\nprint(replace_digits_and_remove_all_non_digits(s4))\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%% md\n"}},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Q: Students marks dashboard\n\nconsider the marks list of class students given two lists\n\nStudents = 'student1','student2','student3','student4','student5','student6','student7','student8','student9','student10'\n\nMarks = 45, 78, 12, 14, 48, 43, 45, 98, 35, 80\n\nfrom the above two lists the Student0 got Marks0, Student1 got Marks1 and so on\n\nyour task is to print the name of students\n\n- a.

If sign of Equation becomes  positive with this, then change `sign_of_equation_with_red_point_tuple` to be plus 1 ( 1 )\n- Now assuming `sign_of_equation_with_red_point_tuple` to be plus one ( 1 ) do the below step\n- One by one, check for all the Red side's tuples (points) - if Equation sign becomes negative for any point > That means that single point is on the other side of the Line Equation.\n- So in that case, then return 'NO' from the function.\n- Similarly in the next step, assuming `sign_of_equation_with_red_point_tuple` to be negaive 1 (-1), do the below step\n- Ony by one, check for all the Red side's tuples (points) - if Equation sign becomes positive for any point > That means that single point is on the other side of the Line Equation.\n- So in that case, then return 'NO' from the function.\n- Do both the above steps for the Blue side as well.\n- And if none of the above 4 steps returns a 'NO' ans, then finally return 'YES' from the function.\n"},{"metadata":{"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import math\n\n\ndef i_am_the_one(red, blue, line):\n    sign_of_equation_with_red_point_tuple = -1\n\n    if eval(line.replace('x', '*%s' % red[0][0]).replace('y', '*%s' % red[0][1])) > 0:\n        sign_of_equation_with_red_point_tuple = 1\n\n    for red_point in red:\n        if sign_of_equation_with_red_point_tuple == 1 and eval(\n                line.replace('x', '*%s' % red_point[0]).replace('y', '*%s' % red_point[1])) < 0:\n            return 'NO'\n\n        if sign_of_equation_with_red_point_tuple == -1 and eval(\n                line.replace('x', '*%s' % red_point[0]).replace('y', '*%s' % red_point[1])) > 0:\n            return 'NO'\n\n    # Now the same set of two traversal for the blue-points tuples\n\n    sign_of_equation_with_blue_point_tuple = -1 * sign_of_equation_with_red_point_tuple\n\n    for blue_point in blue:\n        if sign_of_equation_with_blue_point_tuple == 1 and eval(\n                line.replace('x', '*%s' % blue_point[0]).replace('y', '*%s' % blue_point[1])) < 0:\n            return 'NO'\n\n        if sign_of_equation_with_blue_point_tuple == -1 and eval(\n                line.replace('x', '*%s' % blue_point[0]).replace('y', '*%s' % blue_point[1])) > 0:\n            return 'NO'\n\n    return 'YES'\n\n\nRed = [(1, 1), (2, 1), (4, 2), (2, 4), (-1, 4)]\nBlue = [(-2, -1), (-1, -2), (-3, -2), (-3, -1), (1, -3)]\n\nLines = [\"1x+1y+0\", \"1x-1y+0\", \"1x+0y-3\", \"0x+1y-0.5\"]\n\nfor i in Lines:\n    yes_or_no = i_am_the_one(Red, Blue, i)\n    print(yes_or_no)\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Q - Filling the missing values in the specified format\n\nYou will be given a string with digits and '\\_'(missing value) symbols you have to replace the '\\_' symbols as explained\n\nEx 1: _, _, _, 24 ==> 24/4, 24/4, 24/4, 24/4 i.e we. have distributed the 24 equally to all 4 places\n\nEx 2: 40, _, _, _, 60 ==> (60+40)/5,(60+40)/5,(60+40)/5,(60+40)/5,(60+40)/5 ==> 20, 20, 20, 20, 20 i.e. the sum of (60+40) is distributed equally to all 5 places\n\nEx 3: 80, _, _, _, _  ==> 80/5,80/5,80/5,80/5,80/5 ==> 16, 16, 16, 16, 16 i.e. the 80 is distributed qually to all 5 missing values that are right to it\n\nEx 4: _, _, 30, _, _, _, 50, _, _\n\n==> we will fill the missing values from left to right\n    a. first we will distribute the 30 to left two missing values (10, 10, 10, _, _, _, 50, _, _)\n    b. now distribute the sum (10+50) missing values in between (10, 10, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, _, _)\n    c. now we will distribute 12 to right side missing values (10, 10, 12, 12, 12, 12, 4, 4, 4)\nfor a given string with comma seprate values, which will have both missing values numbers like ex: \"_, _, x, _, _, _\" you need fill the missing values\nQ: your program reads a string like ex: \", , x, , , _\" and returns the filled sequence\n\nEx:\n\nInput1: \"_,_,_,24\"\nOutput1: 6,6,6,6\n\nInput2: \"40,_,_,_,60\"\nOutput2: 20,20,20,20,20\n\nInput3: \"80,_,_,_,_\"\nOutput3: 16,16,16,16,16\n\nInput4: \"_,_,30,_,_,_,50,_,_\"\nOutput4: 10,10,12,12,12,12,4,4,4\n\n---\n\n#### So the rule for calculation of missing value is -\n\n- 1.

Mathematically\n\n`P(A|B) = P(A intersection B) / P(B)`\n\nSo here e.g.\n\n`P(F=F1 | S == S2) = P (F1 intersection S2 ) / P (S2)`\n\nIf A and B are independent, then P(B|A) = P(B), and P(A|B) = P(A), and in this case I don’t need to do any extra mathematics, and P(A|B) is P(A),\n\nSo in that case P(F=F1 | S == S2) would be 1/5.\n\nBut here, the assumption is that A and B are NOT independent, the question of conditional probability calculation does not arise at all.\n\n\n### Now first let’s check how we are calculating Conditional Probabilities from list of lists or 2-D Matrix\n\nIf we have list of lists. Lets assume I have two elements F and S like below.\n\n[F,S]\n\nAnd the values they take are\n\n[[1,3],[1,2],[2,4],[2,2],[3,2]]\n\nWhat is P(F1|S2)?\n\nP(F1)=2/5 (because there are 2 lists containing F=1) of the total 5 lists\nP(S2)=3/5 (because there are 3 lists containing S=2) of the total 5 lists\n\nNow for P(F1 n S2) it can be said as: “The Probability that a randomly chosen list has both F=1 and S=2”.\n\nSo P(F1 n S2) = 1/5 (because there is only one list where the list has both F=1 and S=2, out of 5 lists)\n\nSo Now P(F=F1|S==S2) = P(F1 intersection S2 ) / P (S2) = (1/5) / (3 / 5 ) = ( 1 / 5 ) * ( 5 / 3 ) = 1 / 3\n\n**In another words P(F1|S2) can also be expressed as**\nP(F1|S2) = 1/3 ( since given S=S2, means there are only 3 lists, and out of which F=F1 is only 1 list).\n\nFrom above we can absolutely confirm that F1 and S2 are NOT independent. Because, it’s not possible for F1 and S2 to be independent if an outcome of one of the events changes the probability of the other event.\n\n### Explanations of how P(F=F1|S==S2)=1/3 for our data point given in the quesion\n\nWe know the Math Equation that  P(F=F1|S==S2) = P(F1 intersection S2 ) / P (S2)\n\nP(F1 n S2) = 1/10\nP(S2) = 3/10.\n\nSo P(F=F1|S==S2) = P(F1 intersection S2 ) / P (S2) =\nP(F1 n S2) / P(S2)  =\n(1/10) / (3/10) =\n(1/10) * (10/3) (by the rule of multiplicative inverse) =\n1/3 = P(F1|S2)"},{"metadata":{"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n\ndef compute_conditional_probability(A):\n    # From the given 2-D Matrix A\n    # Set a dictionary containing the count of all the F and S together\n    # This dictionary will have as many elements as the given Matrix A\n    dictionary_f_intersection_s = dict()\n    for item_list in A:\n        dict_key = str(item_list[0]) + str(item_list[1])\n        dictionary_f_intersection_s[dict_key] = 0\n    # print(dictionary_f_intersection_s)\n    # {'F1S1': 0, 'F2S2': 0, 'F3S3': 0, 'F1S2': 0, 'F2S3': 0, 'F3S2': 0, 'F2S1': 0, 'F4S1': 0, 'F4S3': 0, 'F5S1': 0}\n\n    # Set a dictionary containing the count of all the S only\n    dictionary_s = {'S1': 0, 'S2': 0, 'S3': 0}\n\n    for i in range(len(A)):\n        f_intersection_s_key = A[i][0] + A[i][1]\n        dictionary_f_intersection_s[f_intersection_s_key] += 1\n\n        s_key = A[i][1]\n        dictionary_s[s_key] += 1\n\n    # print('a.
